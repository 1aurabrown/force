In the films, Tinari reflects upon the current state of contemporary art in China, as highlighted through the work of four Chinese artists: \u003ca href=\"https://artsy.net/artist/ai-weiwei\">Ai Weiwei\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://artsy.net/artist/cao-fei\">Cao Fei\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://artsy.net/artist/cai-guo-qiang\">Cai Guo-Qiang\u003c/a>, and \u003ca href=\"https://artsy.net/artist/xu-zhen\">Xu Zhen\u003c/a>, the commissioned artist for The Armory Show 2014. All four films will be screened to both fair-going and online audiences. Featured here are the first three films from the series.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When discussing each of the three artists previously featured by Art21—Ai Weiwei, Cao Fei, and Cai Guo-Qiang—Tinari identifies a common interest in the cultural identity of China and the Chinese population, along with its relationships both locally and globally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Ai, Tinari notes a fascination with the effect of China’s productivity upon the lives of individuals, as demonstrated through the artist’s frequent employment of local artisans for the creation of his works. Tinari also identifies Western artists Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol as key influences for Ai’s work as an artist.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Cao, Tinari sees “an example of how one can be a Chinese artist working in a global context.” Tinari cities the lengths of time that Cao spent with local factory workers—from factories that produce goods for global consumption—as a representation of the artist’s interest of “engaging with the wider world on her terms.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Of Cai, Tinari mentions the artist’s signature work with gunpowder, describing the material as something that “speaks to the ingenuity of the Chinese people.” Tinari explores the on-going influence of the artist’s travels to—and current residence in—the West, and its relationship to his own Chinese identity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>These videos serve as companion pieces to each artist’s original appearance in Art21’s \u003ci>Art in the Twenty-First Century\u003c/i> series. These videos, as well as additional videos from Art21’s \u003ci>Exclusive\u003c/i> and \u003ci>Artist to Artist\u003c/i> series, can be viewed on \u003ca href=\"http://www.art21.org\">Art21.org\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Philip Tinari first partnered with Art21 in 2009, interviewing Cao Fei in Beijing for \u003ca href=\"http://www.art21.org/films/art-in-the-twenty-first-century-season-5-2009\">Season 5\u003c/a> (2009) of the \u003ci>Art in the Twenty-First Century\u003c/i> series.
