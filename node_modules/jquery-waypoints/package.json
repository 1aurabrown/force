Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n- [Scroll Analytics](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/examples/scroll-analytics)\r\n- [Dial Controls](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/examples/dial-controls)\r\n\r\n## AMD Module Loader Support\r\n\r\nIf you're using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), Waypoints registers itself as a named module, `'waypoints'`. Shortcut scripts are anonymous modules.\r\n\r\n## Development Environment\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to Waypoints, I love pull requests that include changes to the source `coffee` files as well as the compiled JS and minified files. You can set up the same environment by running `make setup` (which just aliases to `npm install`). This will install the version of CoffeeScript and UglifyJS that I'm using. From there, running `make build` will compile and minify all the necessary files. Test coffee files are compiled on the fly, so compile and minify do not apply to those files.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011-2014 Caleb Troughton\r\nLicensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints/blob/master/licenses.txt).\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nUnit tests for Waypoints are written with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and [jasmine-jquery](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery).  You can [run them here](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/test/). If any of the tests fail, please open an issue and include the browser used, operating system, and description of the failed test.\r\n\r\n## Donations\r\n\r\n[![Gittip donate button](http://img.shields.io/gittip/imakewebthings.png)](https://www.gittip.com/imakewebthings/ \"Donate weekly to this project using Gittip\")\r\n",
