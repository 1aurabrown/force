  "readme": "# jquery.fillwidth\n\nA jQuery plugin that given a `ul` with images inside their `lis` will do some things to line them up\nso that everything fits inside their container nice and flush to the edges. Used throughout [Artsy](http://artsy.net) to make rows of images fit inside a fluid container and still stay flush without cropping the images.\n\n![Example Artsy Screenshot](screenshots/fill_width.jpg)\n\nSee [this example](http://craigspaeth.github.io/jquery.fillwidth/example) using [placekitten.com](http://placekitten.com/) for a basic implementation.\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a DOM structure such as\n\n````html\n<ul id='fill'>\n  <li>\n    <img>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n````\n\nThen apply the fillwidth plugin.\n\n````javascript\n$('#fill').fillwidth()\n````\n\n## Options\n\njquery.fillwidth takes a number of options you can pass to it's constructor.\n\n### resizeLandscapesBy { Number } (default 200)\n\nFillwidth will try to reduce images that are landscape (longer in width than height) up to a certain amount of pixels. Change this number to adjust the maximum amount of pixels fillwidth is allowed to reduce landscapes.\n\n![Landscape Reduce Example](http://cl.ly/image/061J3y1g2C2U/Image%202012.12.03%203:27:57%20PM.png)\n\n### resizeRowBy { Number } (default 30)\n\nFillwidth will try to subtly reduce the entire height of each row up to a certain amount of pixels. Change this number to adjust the maximum amount of pixels fillwidth is allowed to reduce each row by.\n\n![Row Height Reduce Example](http://cl.ly/image/2B3a2127330a/Image%202012.12.03%203:38:41%20PM.png)\n\n### beforeFillWidth { Function }\n\nPass in a callback before fillwidth does it's magic and tries to line up images\n\n### afterFillWidth { Function }\n\nPass in a callback right after fillwidth does it's magic and lines up images.\n\n### imageDimensions { Array }\n\nIf you know the dimensions of the child images before they finish loading, pass in an array of `{ width: X, height: X }` hashes for a quicker fillwidth that calculates before the images finish loading. See the [example](https://github.com/craigspaeth/jquery.fillwidth/blob/master/example/index.html) for how this is done.\n\n````javascript\n$('#fill').fillwidth({\n  resizeLandscapesBy: 100,\n  resizeRowBy: 40,\n  beforeFillWidth: function() {},\n  afterFillWidth: function() {},\n  imageDimensions: [{ width: 100, height: 120 }]\n})\n````\n\n## To build\n\nFillwidth is written in coffeescript and must therefore be compiled before contributing updates.\n\n* Install [node](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)\n* Install [coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) `npm install coffee-script`\n\n````\ncake build\n````\n\n## License\n\nMIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).\n",
