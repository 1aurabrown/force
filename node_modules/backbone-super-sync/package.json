  "readme": "# Backbone Super Sync\n\nA server-side Backbone.sync adapter that does HTTP requests in node using [super-agent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent).\n\n## Example\n\n````javascript\nvar Backbone = require('backbone');\nBackbone.sync = require('backbone-super-sync');\n````\n\n## Adding to the Backbone.sync request\n\nSometimes you need to add to the requests made by Backbone.sync, such as adding an XAPP token. Backbone Super Sync provides the method `editRequest` to intercept the super-agent request object before the request is made.\n\n**NOTE**: This is injected into _ALL_ server-side Backbone.sync calls. This behaves signifcantly different than when Backbone is used on the client. For instance you should not use this to add user-specific data to a request like an oauth access token or similar identifier where as on the client you might want to inject that kind of data sync-wide b/c the browser only represents one user.\n\n````javascript\nvar Backbone = require('backbone');\nvar superSync = require('backbone-super-sync');\nsuperSync.editRequest(function(req) {\n  req.set({ 'XAPP-TOKEN': 'foobar' });\n});\nBackbone.sync = superSync;\n````\n\nThe arguments of Backbone.sync are also passed to editRequest in case you need to globally adjust the request based off `options` or otherwise.\n\n````javascript\nsuperSync.editRequest(function(req, method, model, options) {\n  req.set({ 'X-ACCESS-TOKEN': options.user.get('access_token') });\n});\n````\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease fork the project and submit a pull request with tests. Install node modules `npm install` and run tests with `make test`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
