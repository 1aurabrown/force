# ImagesView

View/templates that handle rendering of the primary artwork image & the sub-navigation when there are multiple images.

The AdditionalImages collection is currently the keeper of the state about which image is "active" (the large image being currently displayed).

See https://github.com/artsy/force/pull/2453 for context.
